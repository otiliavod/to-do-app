# To Do App

This is a to do list application where a user can create an account or sign in in order to view their tasks. The user can create, update
or delete tasks. Each task has their own details that can be viewed by clicking on the task title.
The user can also update their profile, field by field(first name, last name and/or password). Sending at least one of these properties
will update only that property, the rest of them will not be modified.
